iOS Coding Challenge Task

 This challenge has the goal to give us an impression of your coding skills. You have 24 hours of time to implement. Upload the following project as ZIP file using the Owncloud account we provided you.

Functional Requirements

You will need an API key for the the Pixabay public web services. It can be retrieved from this page (you must be logged in to see it): https://pixabay.com/api/docs/#api_search_images

  The user should be able to search for images entering one or more words in a text field

  Request the Pixabay API to show the images associated with the text provided by the user and parse the JSON response.

  Display a list of results. Each entry should show:
    • A thumbnail of the image
    • The Pixabay user name
    • A list of image’s tag

Cache the response

  With a press on a list item a detail screen is opened. The detail screen should contain:
    • A bigger version of the image
    • The name of the user
    • A list of image’s tag
    • The number of likes
    • The number of favorites
    • The number of comments

When the app starts it should trigger a search for the string “apples”

If you have any final comments about your result please let us know creating a file called README.md inside the root directory of the project.

For bonus points demonstrate an understanding of how you would test your code.
